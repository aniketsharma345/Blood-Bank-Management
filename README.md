INTRODUCTION

Blood banks collect, store and provide collected blood to the patients who are in need of blood. The people who donate blood are called donors. The banks then group the blood which they receive according to the blood groups. They also make sure that the blood is not contaminated. The main mission of the blood bank is to provide the blood to the hospitals and health care systems which saves the patient’s life. No hospital can maintain the health care system without pure and adequate blood.

The major concern each blood bank has is to monitor the quality of the blood and monitor the people who donates the blood, that is ‘donors’. But this a tough job. The existing system will not satisfy the need of maintaining quality blood and keep track of donors. To overcome all these limitations, we introduced a new system called ‘Blood Donation Management System’.

The ‘Blood Bank Management System’ allows us to keep track of quality of blood and also keeps track of available blood when requested by the acceptor. The existing systems are Manual systems which are time consuming and not so effective. ‘Blood Bank Management system’ automates the distribution of blood. This database consists of thousands of records of each blood bank.

By using this system searching the available blood becomes easy and saves lot of time than the manual system. It will hoard, operate, recover and analyze information concerned with the administrative and inventory management within a blood bank. This system is developed in a manner that it is manageable, time effective, cost effective, flexible and much man power is not required.
